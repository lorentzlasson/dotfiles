## Git commit message rules

- NEVER use "and" in subject line - think abstractly about the common theme of the diff
- commit messages SHOULD be a single high-level subject line MOST of the time
- if there's something PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY, you are allowed to add one extra line in the body
- use lowercase for ALL text except proper names
- do NOT follow "conventional commits" with type prefix
